## Portfolio Website

Repository for my personal portfolio website, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. **Live:** [tegaidogun.dev](https://tegaidogun.dev/)

### Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then follow these simple steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tegaidogun/tegaidogun.github.io.git
    cd tegaidogun.github.io
    ```
    
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

### Customization

All portfolio content is managed in the `content_option.js` file, making customization simple and straightforward. Any updates made to this file are automatically reflected on the website.

### Deployment

Honestly, the easiest way to deploy the website is through [Vercel](https://vercel.com) but I personally prefer using [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com).
